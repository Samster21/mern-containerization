This repo is a PoC of Docker compose that I did by following Abhishek Veeramalla sir's guidance. I have containerized a simple mern-stack application that records employee details. 

To run, 
1.Ensure that the Docker Engine is installed and is running
2.In a terminal, clone this repo and navigate into the project folder
3.Run the following command: docker compose up
4.Et voila! You should have a working website running in port 5173 ! To access, go to any browser and type localhost:5173
